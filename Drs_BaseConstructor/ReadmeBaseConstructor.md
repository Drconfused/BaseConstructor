	Quest lines
		BaseConstructor
			Quests that require you to get particular blocks and place them and follow an upgrade path. Don't get ahead of yourself with upgrading everything at once and follow the linear upgrade path. Helps unlock better tools early in the game.
		MaterialTrader
			Starts after finishing the BaseConstructor1 quest. This allows you to make a work order that you cash in as a quest reweard if you have the right items in your inventory to trade for the work order you craft in your recipes. So far we have the ability to obtain:
				Cobblestone
				Cement
				Forged Iron
				Forged Steel
				Flagstone Block
				Rebar Frames
				Scrap Iron Frames
				Poured Concrete
				
				You just need the ingredients it normally takes to craft these objects. Every quest gives you 100 dukes and 100 exp, helps a lot early in game.
				
	Blocks
		Steel Block now upgrades to Stainless Steel Block
		Barbed Wire Sheet now has a single upgrade to Barbed Wire Sheet 01 that has 500 damage and downgrades to Barbed wire.

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~MADNESS NOTES~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->			

	1. I want to continue the building format of the basic survival quests. What is the basis and where do the outcomes point towards?
	
	2. 
		// After cashing in the initial start quest start the Base Constructor quest.
			Can give it as a note rather then force start or we can see how to make a popup like the initial start quest.
			
				Trader wants
				
				
		//Greetings Survivor, if you have come across this note, be aware that we have set up a system of trades across the habitable land for those that would work hard and bring materials for already made building materials. 
		2.1 We want to start you out small, bring to a trader 
			20 clay 
			or
			20 stone and we will give you 10 flagstone blocks
			
	3. Base Constructor series
		Make it so that this is the quest series right after finding the trader. It should come across like the trader is helping his community grow. It should be a significant reward as far as Dukes go, make it clear that the trader is doing this for insentive to have a good trade partner.
			3.1 Trading basic materials for the recipe equivalent to make them through quests cashed in at the trader.
			3.2 Should they be craftable notes? Or should they be found? How should the quest system work?
				3.2.1 For starters making it a hand it to the trader so it can be assessed how well that works. Adds a little more to the idea of a functional trading system.
